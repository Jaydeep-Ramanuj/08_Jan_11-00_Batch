        <p>
          As shown in the referenced figure, an automotive engine is a positive
          displacement internal combustion engine having an intake, compression,
          combustion and exhaust stroke. A gas turbine engine is a dynamic
          internal combustion engine.

        <h3>Vehicle exhaust</h3>
        <p>
          Your vehicle's exhaust system is made up of a complex system of pipes
          and devices that serve four essential functions: collect gases from
          the engine, remove harmful toxins from those gases, reduce engine
          noise and discharge the gases away from the car's occupants
